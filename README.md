# Custom Classifiers
This repository provides a collection of *custom* machine learning classifiers and regression models, each implemented from scratch for transparency and extensibility. The focus is on clarity, educational value, and adaptability to specialized tasks.

## Included Models

- **Custom Logistic Regression:** A binary classifier with support for regularization and customizable optimization routines.
- **Custom Decision Tree:** An interpretable decision tree classifier supporting various splitting criteria and pruning strategies.
- **Custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A straightforward KNN classifier with configurable distance metrics and weighting options.
- **Robust Linear Regression:** A regression model designed to be less sensitive to outliers, using robust loss functions for improved generalization.
- **Fixed Effects Model for Panel Data:** A regression model tailored for panel (longitudinal) data, accounting for entity-specific effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity.

Each model includes:
- Clear API documentation and usage examples.
- Tests to ensure correctness.
- Example scripts for training, evaluation, and application to real datasets.
